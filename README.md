# Flight
FastTrack'D final assessment project. Small flight booking and viewing web application written as a final assessment for the FastTrack'D program.
Generates the given number of flights at a given interval and allows a user to view and book flights in a web application on the
front-end. Also has a simple login system incorporating bcrypt on the front-end to keep up with previously booked flights. This project
was not written with the intent of being deployed, but only as a final assessment for FastTrack'D to measure my progress
throughout the program.

## Getting Started

To view the project, first clone the repository into a location you can easily access. Next, import the existing Maven project into
Eclipse or a similar Java IDE and run the Maven project as a Spring Boot Application. Assuming you have postgreSQL set up correctly
for your system, you should now be able to access parts of the database through endpoints on localhost at port 8000.  If you have nodejs installed, go to the ui folder in a console window and run npm install, which will install all the dependencies you'll need to run the website, then npm start will start the front end on localhost at port 8080.
